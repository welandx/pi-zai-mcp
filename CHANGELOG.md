## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-18

### Changed

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Initial public release of `pi-zai-mcp`.
- Pi package extension entrypoint for Z.ai MCP tools.
- Generic MCP tool discovery and call tools for search, reader, zread, and vision servers.
- Dynamic wrapper registration for discovered Z.ai MCP tools.
- Output truncation to pi's standard 50 KB / 2000 line limits with full output saved to a temp file.
- Release metadata, MIT license, and npm/GitHub install documentation.

### Changed
- Package layout now uses a conventional `extensions/` entrypoint for public pi package installs.
- Z.ai MCP discovery no longer runs by default during extension startup; call `z_ai_mcp_list_tools` or set `Z_AI_MCP_AUTO_DISCOVER=1` to discover wrappers.

### Security
- Vision MCP server execution is pinned to `@z_ai/mcp-server@0.1.4` when the local dependency is unavailable.
